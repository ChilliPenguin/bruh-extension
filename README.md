# The bruh extension
The bruh extension converts any web page's text into `bruh`(s). Thats it, really.

# How to use
Its as easy as three steps!
1. Install it via github or via the [chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bruh/jdlgoebkipoinomjfgpggjhmoaoekmce) (Note: Github will almost always have an updated version due to googles review process)
2. Click on the bruh icon(if it is not visable, click on the extension menu[the wierd puzzle piece] and pin it!)
3. A popup will ... *pop up*, click on the button(or slider) and there you go.
